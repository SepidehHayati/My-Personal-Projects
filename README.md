# Personal Projects

 I am currently working on a series of data analysis and analytics projects, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. These projects combine tools like Python, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Machine Learning to enhance my skills and knowledge in these areas. As I continue to learn and grow, I will add new projects regularly, so feel free to check back for updates.
 
## Current Projects (Beginner Level)

#### 1. Building a BMI Calculator with Python:
A simple `Python` project where I build a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. The calculator takes user input and returns the calculated BMI value along with a health category based on the result.

#### 2. Building an Automated File Sorter in File Explorer using Python:
This project automates the process of sorting files in the file explorer based on file types. I used `Python` to categorize and move files into respective folders, making file management easier.

#### 3. Scraping Data from a Real Website:
A basic web scraping project where I scrape data from a real website using `Python`. The data is extracted and stored for further analysis, showcasing how to use web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup and requests.
