# Personal Projects
 
Here, I share my ongoing data analysis and Python programming projects, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The projects are a combination of Python programming, SQL, Pandas, and other data analysis tools, to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas. As I continue to learn and grow, Iâ€™ll be adding new projects, so feel free to check back for updates.

## Current Projects (Beginner Level)

#### 1. Building a BMI Calculator with Python:
A simple `Python` project where I build a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. The calculator takes user input and returns the calculated BMI value along with a health category based on the result.

#### 2. Building an Automated File Sorter in File Explorer using Python:
This project automates the process of sorting files in the file explorer based on file types. I used `Python` to categorize and move files into respective folders, making file management easier.

#### 3. Scraping Data from a Real Website:
A basic web scraping project where I scrape data from a real website using `Python`. The data is extracted and stored for further analysis, showcasing how to use web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup and requests.
